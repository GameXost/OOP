# DYLDIN SERGEY
	laba_1 is ready 


# Just a short intro for running the code 

#### from "OOP/build" run the next command: 
```cmake --build . ```

#### then to run tests from build enter:

```ctest```


#### or to compile the laba enter the next:

```./laba1/laba1_exe```

## that's all, just change the number in NAME of laba to get any other


### in case build is empty or not exsist, use:
```
mkdir build
cd ./build

```

# that's defenitely all needed
